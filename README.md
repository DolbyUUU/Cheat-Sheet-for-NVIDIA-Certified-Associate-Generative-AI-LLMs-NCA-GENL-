## Exam Structure and Key Focus Areas

Based on my experience, the NCA-GENL exam can be broadly categorized into two primary domains.

### 1. Foundational AI, ML, and LLM Concepts (Difficulty: ★★)

This portion covers fundamental concepts in machine learning and generative AI. Candidates with a computer science background or practical experience in the field will likely find these topics familiar. The questions are generally high-level.

**Key topics include:**
- Fundamentals of machine learning and neural networks
- Prompt engineering and alignment techniques
- Data analysis, visualization, and preprocessing
- Experiment design and feature engineering

> **Note:** The exam may also lightly touch upon concepts like Diffusion models, multimodality, and traditional ML algorithms (e.g., SVM), but the questions are typically conceptual.

### 2. The NVIDIA Generative AI Ecosystem (Difficulty: ★★★)

This is a critical and often challenging component of the exam. It requires a specific understanding of NVIDIA's full-stack platform, including its software, tools, and services for developing and deploying AI solutions. A significant portion of the exam is dedicated to testing your knowledge of how these components work together.

This cheat sheet places a strong emphasis on this area, as deep familiarity with tools beyond just CUDA is essential for success.
